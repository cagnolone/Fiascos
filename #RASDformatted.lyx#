\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this document is to analyse the needs of the costumer and to
 provide a solid solution for them, describe the functional and non functional
 requirements of the system, show the constraints of the software and reproduce
 the scenarios and use cases that will likely happen.
 The document serves as a standard for all the developers that are going
 to implement the features for the standard software as well as future implement
ations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Actual System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software is needed to provide an efficient solution for the company
 PowerEnjoy, which purpose is to grant a car-sharing service.
 There is no software prior to this and the service is yet to be launched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of the software house is to grant a functioning mobile app that
 will be used by customers to access the system.
 Users will search for an available electric car they can use to reach their
 destination.
 Users must register to the system providing a valid ID, driving license,
 and payment information.
 Once registered, the user can search for a car in his proximity or near
 a certain address.
 When they find a suitable car, they can reserve it for a certain amount
 of time.
 As the user reaches the car, the system unlocks the car and the user begins
 his ride.
 The vehicle is started and the charging process begins – it will finish
 when the user leaves the car after after having turned it off.
 Money is received via the payment infos the user provided, and the process
 ends with the car returning to a 'free' status.
 This is the standard micro-process of the app, though there are a lot of
 details left unspecified for now – they will be described through the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system must eventually inform employees if some cars are left by customers
 with not enough power, so they can pick them up and recharge them on the
 nearest power station.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Actors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Customer: the principal user of the system, has to be logged in in the system
 to perform any action except the registration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employee – viene avvisato tramite sms con delle coordinate per la macchina
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
List of the principal focus of the system:
\end_layout

[G1] : Allow users to register to the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G2] : Allow users to log into the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G3] : Allow registered users to search for available cars within a certain
 area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G4] : Manage car reservations requested by users.

\begin_layout Section
Overall Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product Perspective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The product will be a mobile application, integrated with a GPS system and
 with a payment system.
 It will rely on a database and will be entirely user-based: the employees
 will only be contacted via SMS by the system if needed, but they are not
 going to actually use the app.
 The software will not provide any API for integration purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User Characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect a user that requires an easy interface for the reservation of
 the car.
 The user must have access to Internet and a GPS on his smartphone.

Domain Assumptions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D1] : All the vehicles involved in the document are PowerEnjoy's property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D2] : Users, cars and employees are traceable by GPS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D3] : All the users presented in the document are registered and logged
 in, except for where it is explicitly stated the opposite.
 (OCIOOOOOOOOO)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D4] : The set of safe areas for parking cars is pre-defined by the management
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
in riferimento al goal 1:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
[D5] : In order to grant the identification of users, we assume that all
 the required information for the registration are authentic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D6] : We assume that registering users always provide valid credentials
 (email, driving license, payment method).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
[D7] : When the user leaves the car, it means the user is closing the driver's
 door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D8] : Carseats are equipped with weight sensors.
 (la gente può cheatare?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D9] : Cars are equipped with a GPS navigator .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D10]: Employee are given keys to unlock cars manually, due to prevent a
 fail of the car electronic system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D11] : All the GPS always give the right position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[D12]: Power station are equipped with a portable generator the employees

User Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
qui mettiamo boh delle schermate o spieghiamo cosa si trova davanti l'utente
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
API interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application relies on 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "GoogleMaps API"
target "https://developers.google.com/maps/"

\end_inset

 to calculate the nearest car from the user position and on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Direct Payment PayPal's API"
target "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_dcc_hub-outside"

\end_inset

 to ensure a safe payment enviroment for the users.
 Both the API are really well-known so the user will have no trouble using
 the service.
 The system must use SMS to coordinate employees, comunicating the coordinates
 of the cars via GoogleMap links.

PowerEnjoy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\shape default
and he wants to use this service.
 He has an android phone, so he searches in the Google Play Store for the
\shape italic
 PowerEnjoy
\shape default
 app and downloads it.
 Bob opens the app, that shows the log in/registration screen.
 Since he is a new costumer, he clicks on the registration button, and the
 app shows him the registration form, with username, cellphone number, email
 address, driving license and payment method fields.
 He fills in all the fields, the data are sent to the system that checks
 if they aren't already used, then the app notifies that the registration
 is complete.
 the system saves the new account in the database and sends Bob a confirmation
 email containing the password he must use to log in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Scenario 2: Log in and car reservation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bob has to go to his friend, who lives 10km far from him, but he doesn't
 want to take the subway, instead he wants to use the 
\shape italic
PowerEnjoy
\shape default
 service.
 He opens the previously downloaded app on his smartphone, fills in the
 username and password fields with his credentials and clicks the login
 button.
 The system checks the correctness of the data, then allows the login process.
 The app shows Bob the home screen, where he can choose from various options.
 Bob clicks on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 option, since he wants to find a nearby car.
 the system processes the request, sends the list of available cars and
 the app shows them on a map screen.
 Bob chooses the nearest car clicking on it, and the app shows a confirmation
 request popup.
 Bob clicks on the confirmation button and the request is processed by the
 system, that changes its status from 
\emph on

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scenario 3: Typical Car usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Karen reserved her car 15 minutes ago, and she just reached its position.
 When she's next to the car, she opens the app and after logging in she
 asks to open her reserved car.
 The system checks if her GPS and the car GPS give the same results, and

 She enters the vehicle and starts the engine: the system now starts to
 charge money to Karen and change the car's status from

 to

unavailable.
 
\emph default
She drives to her destination and then she parks in a safe area.
 She stops and exit the vehicle: the system stops charging the user and
 proceed to check the battery level, which is above 50%: Karen receives
 a 20% discount and the payment is now pending in her account waiting for
 the services to be processed.
 The status of the car goes from

to

Scenario 4: Sharing the car to obtain a discount.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Daniel, Mike and Carl want to go to the stadium but the train is way too
 expensive so they decide to rent a car using the 
\emph on
PowerEnjoy 
\emph default
service to save some money.
 After Daniel logged in the service using the app, they search for a car
 near Carl's house using his address and they reserve a car, which status
 in the system goes from 
\emph on
available
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
reserved
\emph default
.
 They reach it and start their trip, and the system changes the car's status
 from 
\emph on
reserved
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
unavailable
\emph default
.
 The electronic car system recognizes that Daniel is not alone with his
 weight-sensor under the other seats and informs the system that there are
 other 2 passengers.
 When they reach the stadium, they leave the car in a safe park area with
 40% battery left.
 The system charges Daniel a 10% discount because there were 3 passengers
 in the vehicle, and the vehicle status changes from 
\emph on
unavailable
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
available
\emph default
.

Scenario 5: Saving Money option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chris wants to go to a museum but he is short on money, so after logging
 in the application he chooses the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Money Saving option
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where the system asks him where he wants to go.
 After submitting the address of the museum, the system checks how many
 power grid with at least 1 free plug are near the address and the ones
 eligible to mantain, as long as possibile, an equal distribution of the
 cars, so that they are not all clumped up in a certain area while leaving
 free most of the others.
 Chris takes a look at the proposed stations and save the address of the
 one he chooses: he will drive to that one and will plug the car in the
 station, so that the after the system has recognized that the user plugged
 in the vehicle, it will apply a 30% discount.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scenario 6A: Bad user behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nicole has reserved and picked up a car (with obvious system car's state
 changes, 
\emph on
available
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
reserved
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
reserved
\emph default
 to 
\emph on
unavailable
\emph default
), but while she was driving to her destination, she notices that the battery
 is running quite low.
 Unfortunately, if she make a deviation or park far from the building where
 she has the appointment, she'll be very late and she can't afford that.
 So she leaves the car more than 3km away from a power station only with
 15% battery left! The system calculates the minimum distance from a power
 station and the battery level of the car: noticing it breaks the behaviour's
 rule, it charges 30% more to Nicole and change the car status from 
\emph on
unavailable 
\emph default
to 
\emph on
out of battery
\emph default
 and sends an SMS to the nearest employee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scenario 6B: Car recharged by Employee
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system, after changing the car status to 
\emph on
out of battery, 
\emph default
searches for the nearest employee and sends him an SMS with a link to the
 coordinates of the car using GoogleMaps.
 The Employee receives the SMS and opens the Maps: he will drive to the
 car and unlock it with his keys, that grant him the access without asking
 the system.
 He will then plug the car to a portable generator he brought with him.
 The system will change the car status when the battery reaches 80% from
 
\emph on
out of battery 
\emph default
to
\emph on
 available, 
\emph default
and the employee will return to the power station where he's assigned.
